ScoreHighlights
===============

James Dagres
DESCRIPTION:
=============
Application to display the score and schedule of sports games from selected sports. The idea of it was to create an application that
would be an app that would display scores. I used HTTML get and pulled JSON data from my ESPN developers key. 
Furthermore, I parsed the data and used abstraction to display events for seven selectable sports. Unfortunately ESPN doesnâ€™t give a parameter for the score of the competitors, I will implement that whenever I get the chance. This code is a draft of the app idea, and is more of a base for anyone that would like to create an app to display scores and sports events.


FEATURES
=======================================
* Can pull events from 6 sports
* Can select and scroll through events
* Uses OO and abstraction to set up display for different sports and events
* Parses ESPN data to create a base score highlights application
